# Movie-rating-system
This Python project leverages the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to build two intelligent systems. It uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict movie ratings based on budget and genre, and implements a Content-Based Recommendation Engine to suggest movies similar to your favorites using natural language processing and cosine similarity.
